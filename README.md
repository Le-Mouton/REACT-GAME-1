<p>Hopeloss is a fast-paced 2D arcade game built with React. You control a small square that rises with each click and falls when idle. If it falls for too long, it disintegrates. The game features temporary platforms you can land on to earn points, portals, bombs, and an increasing difficulty curve. It also includes score tracking, temporary invincibility at the start of each level, and dynamic jump mechanics based on click speed. Simple to play, hard to master.</p>
